### Description

The results of beautification are not what I expect.

### Expected Results

The beautified code should have looked like:

```
<INSERT CODE HERE>
```

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Add code to Atom editor
2. Run command `Atom Beautify: Beautify Editor`
3. This beautified code does not look right!

### Debug

Here is a link to the `debug.md` Gist: https://gist.github.com/...

#### How to create `debug.md` Gist

Note that this will include a copy of your code.
If your code is private, please create a different sample of code that reproduces the problem.

1. In the Atom [command-palette](https://atom.io/packages/command-palette), 
search for and run the command `Atom Beautify: Help Debug Editor`. 
The debugging results will be copied to your clipboard.  
2. Create a new Gist at https://gist.github.com/  
3. Create a file in your new Gist called `debug.md`.  
4. Paste your debugging results from Atom beautify into `debug.md` file in your Gist.  
5. Add a link to your Gist in your new Issue.
