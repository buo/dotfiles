This gives the UI a coherent feel, with whatever syntax theme you like to use.\n\n#### Installation\nInside atom go to settings, select Install and search for Nucleus.\n\nOr install directly from the console:\n\n`apm install nucleus-dark-ui`\n\n#### Requirements\nEvery color used in the UI is taken directly from a (dark) syntax theme. In order for this to work, the syntax theme needs to have a `syntax-variables.less`. A light version of this theme is still being worked on.\n\n#### Support\n[Buy me a coffee to keep me going](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=YW2GB7ABTVCVA)\n\n## Features\n- Clutterless new windows with a flat background.\n![Batman](http://i.imgur.com/U6sn2Ji.png)\n\n- A minimal approach by using only three colors in the background of the theme. All colors used are mixed variations on colors from the syntax theme.\n![Adventurous](http://i.imgur.com/lu29fwb.png)\n\n- Floating modal overlays (Command Palette, Fuzzy Finder etc) with a nice big type, strongly inspired by Spotlight on OS X.\n![Atom Dark Fusion](http://i.imgur.com/tCjZCSV.png)\n\n- Consistent design over different packages. File an issue if you think a package you're using needs some tweaking.\n![Gruvbox](http://i.imgur.com/M26tZ35.png)\n\n#### Themes used in screenshots\nThe syntax themes in the screenshots are some of my personal favorites:\n- [Batman](https://atom.io/themes/batman-syntax)\n- [Adventurous](https://atom.io/themes/adventurous-syntax)\n- [Atom Fusion Dark](https://atom.io/themes/atom-dark-fusion-syntax)\n- [Gruvbox](https://atom.io/themes/gruvbox)\n",
