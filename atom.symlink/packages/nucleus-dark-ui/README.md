# Nucleus Dark UI

Nucleus is an adaptable UI theme for Atom with your favorite syntax coloring at its core! This gives the UI a coherent feel, with whatever syntax theme you like to use.

#### Installation
Inside atom go to settings, select Install and search for Nucleus.

Or install directly from the console:

`apm install nucleus-dark-ui`

#### Requirements
Every color used in the UI is taken directly from a (dark) syntax theme. In order for this to work, the syntax theme needs to have a `syntax-variables.less`. A light version of this theme is still being worked on.

#### Support

## Features
- Clutterless new windows with a flat background.

- A minimal approach by using only three colors in the background of the theme. All colors used are mixed variations on colors from the syntax theme.

- Floating modal overlays (Command Palette, Fuzzy Finder etc) with a nice big type, strongly inspired by Spotlight on OS X.

- Consistent design over different packages. File an issue if you think a package you're using needs some tweaking.
