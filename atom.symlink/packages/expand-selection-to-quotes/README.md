# Atom expand-selection-to-quotes

Expands selections in the Atom editor to single or double quotes.

The default keybinding is Ctrl+' and Cmd+'.

Originally written by Ben Johnson. The original package seems to have disappeared and has deprecations, so I am reposting it with fixes.

This project is based on the awesome work of kek in [sublime-expand-selection-to-quotes](https://github.com/kek/sublime-expand-selection-to-quotes).

Now supports multiple selections! Thanks [@de-monkeyz](https://github.com/de-monkeyz).

## Known Issues
* It assumes that the type of quote to the left of the cursor is the one we want, which is stupid and not always true.
