# Dockerlint

Linting tool for Dockerfiles based on recommendations from
[Dockerfile Reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/) and [Best practices for writing Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/articles/dockerfile_best-practices/) as of Docker 1.6.

## Install

With [npm](https://npmjs.org/) just do:

    $ [sudo] npm install -g dockerlint

## Usage

Once installed it's as easy as:

    dockerlint Dockerfile

Which will parse the file and notify you about any actual errors (such an
omitted tag when `:` is set), and warn you about common pitfalls or bad idiom
such as the common use case of `ADD`.

In order to treat warnings as errors, use the `-p` flag.

### Running from a git clone

If you've cloned this repository, you can run `dockerlint` with:

    make deps # runs npm install
    make js && coffee bin/dockerlint.coffee

If you're building on Windows, you'll have to set the path to your `make`:

    npm config set dockerlint:make "mingw32-make.exe"

or pass it to every invocation:

    npm run build:win --dockerlint:make=mingw32-make.exe

## Roadmap

- Add support for --version which checks against a specific Docker version
- Refactor code to move the rule specific functions into a Rule class
